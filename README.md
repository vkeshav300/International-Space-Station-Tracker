# International Space Station Tracker

This program displays a visual of where the international space station is at the moment. It also tells you who is on board the international space station. All this data is gathered from two APIs ([People API](http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json), [Position API]([API](http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json))) in JSON format giving all the data needed to run this program.
